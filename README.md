## Overview

This simulator helps users develop intuition about optimal bet sizing using the Kelly Criterion formula. Whether you're learning the concept or need to calculate real bets, this tool provides both educational value and practical utility.

### What is the Kelly Criterion?

The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula that determines the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize long-term growth while avoiding ruin. It considers:
- The probability of winning
- The payout odds
- Your current bankroll

Formula: `f* = (bp - q) / b`
Where:
- `f*` = fraction of bankroll to bet
- `b` = net odds received on the bet
- `p` = probability of winning
- `q` = probability of losing (1 - p)
